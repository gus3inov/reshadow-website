**reshadow** has two basic concepts: _elements_ and _modifiers_. It looks similar to the **BEM**, and yes, it is. But let's take a break from BEM and get to the bottom of it.

Take a look at this example:

```css
button[disabled] {
    pointer-events: none;
    opacity: 0.4;
}
```

```js
<button disabled>click me</button>
```

Application's state here was presented by the `button` **element**'s state using `disabled` **modifier**. So yeah, we can describe the web application presentation in terms of elements and modifiers:

-   element - `HTML` element,
-   modifier - element attributes.

And you can easily match styles to the application's state, just by writing CSS selectors on the element and its modifiers, like in the example above.

There are no additional conventions and abstractions, it's just the way `HTML` and `CSS` works. With **reshadow**, we have an intention to build complex UIs, based on basic ideas and strong specification, which exists more than a dozen years.

So, back to BEM, in terms of **reshadow** it could be presented by:

-   **B**lock - Component,
-   **E**lement - Component's presentational elements (markup),
-   **M**odifiers - Component's props and its elements' attributes.

## elements

Let's consider an abstract simplified part of markup:

```js
<div className={styles.container}>
    <div className={styles.tooltip}>
        <div className={styles.content}>{this.props.children}</div>

        <span className={styles.tail} />
    </div>
</div>
```

Leaving aside the issue of quality of that code, `a11y` problems and so on, there is also a problem to read and understand this code.
It's not clear, what **semantics** lays under the markup of this Component, how it was decomposed, how you can also style it on your own.

In fact, this markup is presented by these elements:

-   container,
-   tooltip,
-   content,
-   tail.

It's important to note, that **elements** are not required to be necessary `HTML` elements. These elements are highlighted semantically.

With **reshadow** the part above might look like:

```js
<container>
    <tooltip>
        <content>{this.props.children}</content>

        <tail as="span" />
    </tooltip>
</container>
```

By default for elements that are not supported by the `web platform` **reshadow** uses fallback to the `div` element (you can change this option in [babel options](/setup#babel)).

Thus, **reshadow** brings semantics to the first place, and it's more about _how your component is semantically presented_.

So, the markup above could be styled this way:

```css
container {
    display: flex;
    /* container styles */
}

content {
    /* content styles */
}

/* other elements styles */
```

> **reshadow** will automatically match the elements and styles, so you don't need to match any of them by hands (like in bare `CSS` and `HTML` without classes ðŸ˜‰).

### `as` attribute

It is also possible to apply `as` attribute for any kind of elements to force an element to be presented in DOM with specific tag name.

```js
/*
 * it will be <span>my content</span> in DOM
 * (instead of <div>my content</div> by default)
 */

<content as="span">my content</content>
```

## props and modifiers

Any element or Component declares its own programming interface, which could be named as `props` in `React` way.
**reshadow** allows you to apply any modifiers to existing Components without editing them, so you're able to do minor ad hoc stylization of your Components or [completely restyle it](/advanced/override).
The Component has no access to its modifiers because they're not included in its interface.
`props` and `modifiers` are defined as follows:

-   prop - a part of the Component's or element's interface,
-   modifier - a property that you can set to style the element or Component, but this property was not declared by the interface (among props).

For example, let's consider the `button` element. You can pass the `disabled` attribute to the button, and this is a part of its interface. But what if you want to set `button`'s `size`? In terms of **reshadow** `disabled` would be the **prop**, and `size` - **modifier**.

**reshadow** allows setting modifiers with the `use` namespace.

```js
/**
 * disabled - prop
 * use:size="s" - modifier 'size' with value 's'
 */

<button disabled use:size="s">
    click me
</button>

<Button disabled use:size="s">
    click me
</Button>
```

It is also possible to use the function `use` instead of jsx-namespaces:

```js
import {use} from 'reshadow';

<button disabled {...use({size: 's'})}>
    click me
</button>

<Button disabled {...use({size: 's'})}>
    click me
</Button>
```

All modifiers will be cut with the **reshadow**, so they won't be passed to the element or Component.

Both examples will correspond to the following styles:

```css
button[disabled] {
    /* styles for the disabled button */
}

button[use|size='s'] {
    /* styles for the button with size: s */
}
```

You're able to match your CSS styles to the root DOM-node of any Component you use.
Inside the styles for some Component using `Button` Component inside:

```css
Button[disabled] {
    /* styles for disabled Button Component */
}

Button[use|size='s'] {
    /* the same for the Button Component with size: s */
}
```

It is also possible to use syntax-sugar for modifiers (omit the `use` namespace):

```css
button[|size='m'] {
    /* styles for the button with size: m */
}
```

And you can also use syntax-sugar for pattern-matching for the attributes:

```css
button[type] {
    &='submit' {
        /* styles for the [type="submit"] */
    }

    &=reset {
        /* styles for the [type=reset] */
    }
}

button[|size] {
    &='s' {
        /* styles for the [use|size="s"] */
    }

    &=m {
        /* styles for the [use|size=m] */
    }
}
```
